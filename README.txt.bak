This is to certify that this project is our own work, based on our personal
efforts in studying and applying the concepts learned. We have constructed the
functions and their respective algorithms and corresponding code by ourselves.
The program was run, tested, and debugged by our own efforts. We further certify
that we have not copied in part or whole or otherwise plagiarized the work of
other students and/or persons.
